# UCP Gm Resource Modifier

This repository contains a module for the "Unofficial Crusader Patch Version 3" (UCP3), a modification for Stronghold Crusader.
This module exposes the possibility to modify the loaded gm1 resources of the game.


### Motivation and Plan

**TODO**


### Usage

The module is part of the UCP3. Certain commits of the main branch of this repository are included as a git submodule.
It is therefore not needed to download additional content.

However, should issues or suggestions arise that are related to this module, feel free to add a new GitHub issue.
Support is currently only guaranteed for the western versions of Crusader 1.41 and Crusader Extreme 1.41.1-E.
Other, eastern versions of 1.41 might work.
